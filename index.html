                        <p>I am a full-stack web developer with a particular interest in back-end technologies,including
                            databases, APIs, and linking them to the front-end to create user-friendly, interactive, and
                            intuitive applications.<br><br>

                            Prior to my completing the Web Development Boot Camp at Southern Methodist University I was
                            a
                            public finance and budgeting professional with experience working for large cities and
                            counties
                            in Texas and South Florida.<br><br>

                            In addition to managing multiple complex budgets in excess of $100 million, I became
                            certified
                            as a Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt and participated in multiple process improvement
                            projects.<br><br>

                            I have experience as a Subject Matter Expert and a Project Manager for multiple software
                            implementations, including PeopleSoft Financials and Oracle Planning and Budgeting Cloud
                            (PBCS) and Enterprise Performance Reporting Cloud (EPRCS) solutions.

                    <p>My family and I live in one of the eastern suburbs of Dallas, near Lake Ray Hubbard along with our five four-legged children, three cats and two dogs. <br><br>

                        We moved back to Texas in 2018 from South Florida, where we moved after my wife and I graduated Texas A&M. <br><br>

                        We absolutely love traveling, especially abroad. In fall 2019 we took a two-week vacation to the United Kingdom and visited Ireland, Scotland, and England. As huge Game of Thrones fans, we had to take a tour where we saw locations where multiple scenes, including Winterfell, were produced. Our tour guide was an extra during all of the seasons and had some fantastic stories. As an extra treat, we met two of the Northern Inuit dogs who played the Stark Direwolves.<br><br>
